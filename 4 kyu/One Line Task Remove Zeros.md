Task:  

You are given an integer array ```a``` that contains only digits 0-9. Remove all zeros from the start and end of ```a```.

It is guaranteed that array a has at least two non-zero elements.

Code Limit: Less than ```53``` characters.

Example:

For ```a = [0, 9, 0, 4]```,

the output should be ```[9, 0, 4]```.

For ```a = [0, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]```,

the output should be ```[9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]```.

For ```a = [1, 6, 0, 2]```,

the output should be ```[1, 6, 0, 2]```.

Solutions:
```js
removeZeros=a=>eval(`[${/[^0,].*[^0,]/.exec(a)}]`)
```
